# Visualizations in Galois theory and enumerative geometry

The idea of this repo is to develop some pictures and animations in order to picture various topics in enumerative geometry and Galois theory of enumerative problems. Some of us are interested in migrating our math coding workflow over to Julia, but any/all languages are okay here!
