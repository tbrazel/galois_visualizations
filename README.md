# Visualizations in Galois theory and enumerative geometry

The idea of this repo is to develop some pictures and animations in order to picture various topics in enumerative geometry and Galois theory of enumerative problems. Some of us are interested in migrating our math coding workflow over to Julia, but any/all languages are okay here!

# 🔗 Integration with other software
- [GAP to Julia interface](https://oscar-system.github.io/GAP.jl/dev/basics/) for working with groups

# 🖌️ Aesthetics
- [Colorschemes in Julia](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/generated/colorschemes/)

# 💻 Monodromy computation software (not visualizations):
- [Pandora](https://github.com/tbrysiewicz/Pandora) by Taylor Brysiewicz
- [certified monodromy](https://github.com/klee669/certified_monodromy_comp) by Kisun Lee (this is an early implementation of work of Kisun and Tim Duff)
